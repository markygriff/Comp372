The functions f(n) and g(n) are asymptotically non negative, there exists
n0 suchthatf(n)≥0andg(n)≥0foralln≥n0. Thus,wehave that for all n ≥ n0,
f(n)+g(n) ≥ f(n) ≥ 0 and f(n)+g(n) ≥ g(n) ≥ 0. Adding both inequalities
(since the functions are nonnegative), we get f(n) + g(n) ≥ max(f(n),
g(n)) for all n ≥ n0. This proves that max(f(n), g(n)) ≤ c(f(n) + g(n))
for all n ≥ n0 with c = 1, in other words, max(f (n), g(n)) = O(f (n) + g(n)).
